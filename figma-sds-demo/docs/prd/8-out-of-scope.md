# 8. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **NOT** included in this PRD:

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| New PricingCard variants | Use existing variant system |
| Animation/transitions | Not in Figma design |
| Dark mode support | Already handled by token system |
| Mobile-specific layouts | Handled by existing responsive logic |
| Unit tests | Storybook serves as visual regression |
| New helper functions | Existing `pricingPlanToPricingCardProps` sufficient |
